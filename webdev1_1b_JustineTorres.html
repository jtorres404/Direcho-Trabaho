        <p>Adobo has its roots in prehistoric times. Vinegar was used by early cooks to store and preserve meat before cooling and refrigeration were available. While this concept was used by indigenous people around the world, the Spanish were the people to call it “adobo.” <br />
            <br />
            <!-- This is the Adobo description -->
            In Spain, the adobo you’ll find on restaurant menus refers to the process of marinating raw protein in vinegar, spices, and aromatics including pimentón, fresh garlic, and bay leaves. Wine and/or olive oil often make an appearance. The meat marinates up to a couple of days and is then cooked, resulting in a deeply flavorful protein. As the Spanish colonized much of the world, they took the technique, which can also be used for food preservation, with them.</p>
